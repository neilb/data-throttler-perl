Revision history for Perl module Data::Throttler

0.07 2014-12-?? MSCHILLI
    - Added a SEE ALSO section with links to similar modules.
    - Added min perl version and license type to metadata, and min perl
      version to code.
    - Deleted MYMETA.*, since META files will be generated by EUMM.
    - Renamed the LEGALESE section to be LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT,
      which means that tools like CPANTS will find it.
    - Moved Throttler.pm to lib/Data/, which is the usual convention these days
    - Reformatted this file according to CPAN::Changes::Spec, and corrected
      some of the dates, where were off-by-one, due to 'CPAN time' being GMT
